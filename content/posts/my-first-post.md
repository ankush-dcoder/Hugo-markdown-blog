Hi, this is a blog template using hugo static site generator.

You can write blog posts in content/posts directory in markdown

hugo converts your md file posts to a static blog site, which you can deploy.


You can add more pages by creating new .md files in content/posts

or by executing ./hugo new posts/postname.md in .dcoder_run file and press run.

## Happy coding 
Looking forward to what you'll build with it. \n\nTesting flows.
